Introduction Welcome to the Netflix Homepage Clone project! ðŸŽ¬

Have you ever wanted to recreate the magic of the Netflix browsing experience right in your browser? Well, you've come to the right place! As a fan of Netflix's user interface, I decided to create a clone of their homepage to hone my frontend development skills. This project allowed me to practice HTML structure, CSS styling, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.
